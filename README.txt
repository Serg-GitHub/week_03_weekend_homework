Codeclan E50 week 3, weekend homework.

I have developed a rock, paper, scissors web application using html, python, 
jinja and css inside a flask web framework.

MVP: The initial brief (minimum viable product) was to create an application allowing a user to play a game of 
rock, paper, scissors by entering a path inside the browser such as /rock/scissors 
and return the string "Player 1 wins by playing rock" to the page.

Extension: In the homework extension I added a welcome page, a return home url link in the 
post game output page, rules of the game as well as all 9 user choices in the form or url links 
eliminating the need for user input into the browser.
I have also added CSS in my html pages which is being pulled in from a stylesheet in the static/css directory. 
This includes a background image as well as a resized flex container - setting width, height, 
margin, border radius, background colour and opacity.

I have also included follow along pseudo code inside the python, html and css files.
