Codeclan E50 week 3, weekend homework.

I have developed a rock, paper, scissors web application using html, python, jinja and css inside a flask web framework.

MVP: The initial brief (minimum viable product) was to create an application allowing a user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors by entering a path inside the browser such as /rock/scissors and return the string "Player 1 wins by playing rock" to the page.

Extension: In the homework extension I have added a welcome page, a return home url link in the output page, rules of the game as well as all 9 user choices in the form or url links eliminating the need for user input into the browser.
I have also added some CSS in my html pages which is being pulled in from a stylesheet in the static/css directory. This includes a background image as well as a resized the flex container - setting width, height, margin, border radius, background colour and opacity.
